Completed Design Document - The Gaming Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room aimed to elevate their existing product, Draw It or Lose It. Starting solely as an Android mobile app, the goal was to introduce the product to additional platforms. Draw It or Lose It is a game app that lets users guess what an image depicts within a set amount of time. To host this game, the client wanted to explore all available options from front-end development to backend hosting services. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

My explanations under the recommendation section were very well thought out. Recommending that the gaming app be hosted on a cloud platform would help The Gaming Room set up for success. Allowing them to grow their clientele by reducing scalability issues. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

This project was more focused on building the design document itself. However, my professor pushed me to be thorough with the details. With that level of support, I believe this design document would enable a real client to make an informed decision on where their gaming application will live and expand from.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would definitely improve the detail in my evaluation section. In one of the lengthiest sections, I see that I need to improve my evaluations of client-side development requirements. Using cloud platforms would require using Cloud APIs, and in hindsight, I should have included those details.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The Gaming Room was particular about specific details of their application. One was the need to host 200 high-quality images for the user. In my recommendation section, I specifically mention the advantages of using Cloud Platforms for this challenge. Being able to scale horizontally and expand picture storage would not only meet the clients' needs but also set them up for future success. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Research was key to building the design document. One key detail communicated in the document was the attempt to keep to the plain language standard. Design documents will be shared with real stakeholders to enable them to make informed decisions about a huge investment. I attempted to keep my language as plain as possible, but sometimes it did get away from me.
